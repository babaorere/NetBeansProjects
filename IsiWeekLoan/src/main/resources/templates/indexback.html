        <strong>Verse 1</strong>
        I'm trying to keep my head above water
        I'm trying to keep my head above water
        I'm trying to keep my head above water
        But I'm drowning

        <strong>Chorus</strong>
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        To keep on breathing

        <strong>Verse 2</strong>
        I'm trying to stay afloat
        I'm trying to stay afloat
        I'm trying to stay afloat
        But I'm sinking

        <strong>Chorus</strong>
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        To keep on breathing

        <strong>Bridge</strong>
        I'm trying to find a way out
        I'm trying to find a way out
        I'm trying to find a way out
        But I'm lost

        <strong>Chorus</strong>
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        I'm trying to find a reason
        To keep on breathing

        <strong>Outro</strong>
        I'm trying
        I'm trying
        I'm trying
